About This Repository
=====================
This was a project assigned to me in my Software Engineering class at the University of Oklahoma.

It was a group project that is hosted on BitBucket, but I moved it over here so I could have it with my other repositories.

The project involved designing and implementing a captcha system for Paycom Inc. a payroll software company in Oklahoma City.

There is very little documentation.
